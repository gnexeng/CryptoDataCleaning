\begin{abstract}
In this paper we construct families of bit sequences using combinatorial methods.  Each sequence is derived by converting a collection of numbers encoding certain combinatorial numerics from objects exhibiting symmetry in various dimensions.  Using the algorithms first described in \cite{ALDH} we show that the NIST testing suite described in publication 800-22 does not detect these symmetries hidden within these sequences.

\section{Introduction}

In previous work \cite{ALDH} the authors took a random graph $R_G$ and grew it using the cone (Definition \ref{Cone}) to construct families of higher dimensional objects called simplicial complexes.  Each of these complexes comes equipped with a vector that encodes the number of $i$ simplicies.  One of the main thrusts of \cite{ALDH} was to show that the bit sequence derived from the \textit{$f$-vector} of these higher dimensional objects was deemed ``random" by the NIST testing suite \cite{NIST}.  In the current paper, we show that the NIST test suite fails to see patterns in bit sequences derived from combinatorial objects that are symmetrical in a certain sense (Definition \ref{symmetrical}).

Given a simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$ it is possible to determine a related combinatorial object called a \textit{simple convex polyhedron} whose faces are roughly built out of cones over the geometric realization of certain posets.  In the case that $\mathcal{K}$ is nice, say a simplicial sphere, then the dual $P$ is a \textit{simple convex polytope}.  Polyhedra have $f$-vectors and they encode the number of faces in a given dimension, but we are primarily concerned with those $P$ that are dual to those ``nice" $\mathcal{K}$.  Exactly how this duality works is explained in \S 4.  It is worth noting that determining these vectors and classifying the combinatorial type of $P$ are difficult problems  \cite{KP}.

Simple convex polytopes are interesting and show up in various fields of mathematics. They are well behaved in certain ways and there are other vectors associated to them called the $h$-vector and they exhibit a symmetry described by the Dehn-Sommerville relations.  For such polytopes, these vectors also satisfy a collection of inequalities that are described by the well-known $g$-theorem \cite{B,BP1}.

In this paper we focus on a particularly nice and well-understood family of simple convex polytopes; the standard $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$, for some positive integer $n \geq 1$.  The face structure is understood and the corresponding vectors mentioned above can be determined as well as their dual simplicial complexes (and their respective $f$-vectors).  This group of polytopes is sufficient in demonstrating the claims of the paper.  Namely, the bits derived from complexes built out of the duals of $\Delta^n$ are determined to be random by the NIST test suite even though they are not.


More is true, indeed; if we let $\mathcal{K}$ be the dual of $\Delta^n$, then we construct a family of simplicial complexes $C^j(\mathcal{K})$ and show that they are not dual to a simple convex polytope by applying the $g$-theorem.

%the celebrated $g$-Theorem provides the necessary conditions for the $f$-vector of a given polyhedron to be the $f$-vector of a simple convex polytope.  Using this theorem and the $\mathcal{K}$ dual to $\Delta^n$ we construct $C^j(\mathcal{K})$ and show that this family of complexes are not dual to a simple convex polytope.  This ensures that for $j$ sufficiently large some of the symmetry is broken.  Although, no claim is made that all of the symmetry as encoded in the $f$-vector is destroyed.

\section{Main Results}

The contributions of this paper are:\\[.2ex]
\begin{center}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Construct a family of simplicial complexes that exhibit a symmetry not detected by the NIST test suite. \\[.8ex]
  \item Show that the family of simplicial complexes are not dual to simple polyhedra. \\
\end{enumerate}
\end{center}

Before stating the main results we list the most pertinent definitions.  Let $\mathcal{K}$ be an $n$-dimensional simplicial complex on the set $\{1,\ldots,n-1\}$, then the \textit{cone} on $\mathcal{K}$ is as follows: $C(\mathcal{K}) =   \{   x\cup \{n\}   |  x\in \mathcal{K}  \}  \cup \mathcal{K}$.  Let $j$ be a positive integer, then when the cone is iterated $j$-times, we refer to it as the $j^{th}$-cone on $\mathcal{K}$ and write it as $C^j(\mathcal{K})$.  The dimension of the complex increases as $j$ increases.

To keep track of the number of $i$ simplicies in $\mathcal{K}$ or $C^j(\mathcal{K})$ there is the \textit{$f$-vector} and it is the vector with the number of $i$ simplicies in the $i^{th}$ component.  We represent the $i^{th}$ component of $\overrightarrow{f}(\mathcal{K})$ by $f_{i}(\mathcal{K})$.  The vector is very often written $(f_0,...,f_{n-1})$ where the last component counts the number of maximal dimensional simplicies in $\mathcal{K}$ (as written this vector encodes the number of $i$-simplicies in an $(n-1)$-dimensional simplicial complex).  A simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$ is \textit{symmetrical} if $f_i(\mathcal{K}) = f_{n-i-1}(\mathcal{K})$ for $0 \leq i \leq n-1$.  When the components of this vector are converted into bit sequences, the NIST test suite classifies these as random. The results of the testing can be found in the following GitHub public repository ~\url{https://GitHub.com/gnexeng/coning-analysis.git}. This is a fork of the repository used in ~\cite{ALDH}. %\S \textcolor{red}{let the reader know where to find these results}.

When $\mathcal{K}$ is a \textit{simplicial sphere} (meaning its geometric realization is homeomorphic to a sphere), then there is a simple polytope $P$ that is dual to $\mathcal{K}$ and vice-versa.  We briefly recall the construction; the interested reader can refer to \S4 where a more detailed description is given.  The vertices of $\mathcal{K}$ correspond to the codimension one faces of $P$, the edges correspond to the codimension two faces of $P$ so on and so forth. Given this, the polytope $P$ will satisfy the criteria of the $g$-theorem which describes certain symmetry conditions and inequalities of a vector related to $P$ called the $h$-vector as described by \cite{BP1}. It is related to the vector whose components counts the number of faces of $P$ \cite{BP1}.  Unfortunately, this too, is called the $f$-vector, but when $\mathcal{K}$ is dual to $P$ then there is the following relation that relates the two noting that $(h_0, h_1,\ldots,h_n)$ is the $h$-vector of the dual:  $h_0t^n + \cdots+ h_{n-1}t + h_n  = (t-1)^n + f_0(t-1)^{n-1} + \cdots + f_{n-1}$.

In \cite{B}, the $g$-theorem is stated in terms of certain ``$g_i$" that satisfy a variety of inequalities and they too are related to the components $f_i$ in the $f$-vector of $P$.  If a general $P$ does not satisfy the conditions of the $g$-theorem then it is not simple.  If $\mathcal{K}$ is a random graph $R_G$, then there are equations that follow from the $g$-theorem that one can use to show that the simplicial complexes $C^j(R_G)$ are not simplicial spheres (meaning, the dual $P$ is not simple) for $j$ sufficiently large.\\[.5ex]

The main results are:

\begin{Proposition}\label{No g Theorem}
For a graph $G$ such that $f_1(G) \neq 0$, let $C^{j}(G) = \mathcal{K}^{j+1}$. For $j$ sufficiently large, the complexes $\mathcal{K}^{j+1}$ are not dual to a polytope that satisfies the $g$-theorem.
\end{Proposition}

Proposition \ref{No g Theorem} applies to the case $G = R_G$, a random graph.  In fact, Theorem \ref{No g Theorem} provides us with exactly the number of cones that have to be applied before passing through the class of simple polytopes.
\begin{Theorem} \label{N simplex}
Let $n >1$ and suppose $P^n$ is a polytope such that $\overrightarrow{h}(P^n) = (1,\ldots,1)$, then the $n-1$ dimensional dual simplicial complex $K_P$ is symmetrical.  % let $\overrightarrow{f}(K)$ be the $f$-vector of the dual.  Then $f_j(K) = f_{n-(j+1)}(K)$ for $ 0 \leq j \leq n-1$.
\end{Theorem}

From a testing perspective the main results are as follows: %\textcolor{red}{tell the reader where to go to find these results and summaries}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The components of the $f$-vectors dual to $P$ in Theorem \ref{N simplex} can be found in Pascal's Triangle.  The NIST test suite views the converted bit sequences as random. (see section \S\ref{bitconversions} and \S\ref{results}\\[.5ex] % must test this yet?
  % which row of the pascal triangle generates enough bits to send it to NIST suite
  % convert that row into bits and check

  \item There is a family of complexes given by the $j^{th}$-cone on those complexes constructed from Pascal's Triangle that generate bit sequences that NIST classifies as random. % must be tested? -- Jonathan is running 100 rows of the pascal triangle starting with 4,6,4 ignoring all end 1s. Reason being that from an $h$-vector of 1s the generated $f$-vector in code does not include these 1s. Then, will apply cone about 3750 (to get to 10^7 bits necessary for NIST).

\end{enumerate}

The paper is set-up as follows.  In \S 3 we provide a brief overview of simplicial complexes and the algorithms used to generate $C^j(\mathcal{K})$. We also discuss the notion of the $f$-vector and, for the convenience of the reader, list a few calculations made in \cite{ALDH}. In \S 4 polyhedra and their duals are discussed along with their $f$ and $h$-vectors. The relation between the $f$ and $h$-vectors is given as well as specific low dimensional examples. For completeness, the $g$-Theorem is listed and a reference is provided for additional details. The main theorems needed in the sequel are proved in this section too.  \S 5 contains a careful analysis of bit conversions.  Here, we discuss truncation methods that are used to ensure that the bit-stream fits into the NIST suite.  \S 6 lists the algorithm to convert $f$-vectors to $h$-vectors and vice versa and \S 7 contains a summary of the results. \S8 is an Appendix and it contains additional commentary regarding the original code \cite{ALDH}, the improvement that was made and how to replicate the new and improved results.

\section{Simplicial Complexes and Iterated Cones}

For the convenience of the reader we list background material from \cite{ALDH} along with a few other additions.
\begin{Definition}
Let $X$ be a non-empty set. A simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$ on $X$ is a non-empty subset of the power set of $X$ such that if $x\in \mathcal{K}$ and $y\subset x$ then $y\in \mathcal{K}$.
\end{Definition}

In general $X=\{1,2,\ldots,m\}=[m]$ where $m\in \mathbb{N}$. The sets in $\mathcal{K}$ are called simplices and the dimension of a simplex $x$, denoted $dim(x)$ is defined to be $|x|-1$. The dimension of a simplicial complex is $max\{dim(x)|x\in \mathcal{K}\}$.  If a simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$ is $n-1$ dimensional we simply write $\mathcal{K}^{n-1}$.  From the definition it follows that any simple graph can be regarded as a simplicial complex of dimension at most one.  If such a graph has at least one edge, then it is a one dimensional.

\begin{Remark}
Notice that since $\mathcal{K}$ is a non-empty set and since $\emptyset \subseteq x$ for all subsets of $X$, then by definition $\emptyset\in \mathcal{K}$.
\end{Remark}

\begin{Example}\label{E1}
The set $\mathcal{K}=\{\emptyset,\{1\},\{2\},\{3\},\{1,2\}\}$ is a one-dimensional simplicial complex on the set $\{1,2,3\}$.\\

\begin{Notation}
For a fixed $m\in \mathbb{N}$ let $\widehat{\Delta}^m=P([m])$ where $P([m])$ is the power set on $[m]$.
\end{Notation}
 For instance, $\widehat{\Delta}^2$ is a \textit{2-simplex}.  Pictorially, it is

The following can be found in \cite{BP1}
\begin{Definition}\label{Cone}
Let $\mathcal{K}$ be a simplicial complex on the set $\{1,\ldots,n-1\}$. We define and denote the cone over $\mathcal{K}$ as follows:

 $$C(\mathcal{K}) =  \{   x\cup \{n\} |  x\in \mathcal{K}  \}  \cup \mathcal{K}$$

\end{Definition}

Notice that if $\mathcal{K}$ is an $n$-dimensional complex then $C(\mathcal{K})$ is an $(n+1)$-dimensional complex.  Since $C(\mathcal{K})$ is a simplicial complex it is possible to apply the cone again.

%\captionof{figure}{The second cone on $\mathcal{K}$}
        \end{minipage}\\[2ex]
\normalsize

We write the \textit{$j^{th}$ cone on $\mathcal{K}$} as $C^j(\mathcal{K})$. We have the following from \cite{ALDH} regarding a  graph $G$.

\begin{Lemma}\label{Dim of n cone}
The dimension of $C^j(G)$ is $j+1$.
\end{Lemma}

In general, counting the number of $i$-simplicies for a given simplicial complex is computationally difficult \cite{KP}.  There is a vector that encodes all of these numerics.  We list the following critical definition:

\begin{Definition}\label{fvector}
The $f$-vector of an $(n-1)$-dimensional simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$, denoted by $\overrightarrow{f}(\mathcal{K})$, is the vector with the number of $i$ simplicies in the $i^{th}$ component. We represent the $i^{th}$ component of $\overrightarrow{f}(\mathcal{K})$ by $f_{i}(\mathcal{K})$.
\end{Definition}

For a given fixed $\mathcal{K}$, the following notation is usually used to denote this vector $\overrightarrow{f}(\mathcal{K}) = (f_0,f_1,\ldots,f_{n-1})$. Often it is simply written as $(f_0,f_1,\ldots,f_{n-1})$. For the purposes of making calculations, recall, $f_{-1}(\mathcal{K}) = 1$ \cite{BP1}.  We have the following calculations from \cite{ALDH}; the proofs can be found there.

%\textcolor{red}{Add more examples with f vector calculations here....need the pictures too}
\begin{Example}
For Example \ref{E1} we have $\overrightarrow{f}(\mathcal{K})=(3,1)$.
\end{Example}

\begin{Lemma} \label{Count on Cone}
For a graph $G$, $f_0(C^j(G)) = f_0(G) + j$ and $f_1(C^j(G)) =  f_1(C^{j-1}(G)) +  f_0(C^{j-1}(G))$
\end{Lemma}

As an immediate Corollary of Lemma \ref{Count on Cone} we re-write $f_1(C^n(R_G))$ by unraveling the recursion.

\begin{Corollary}\label{recursion}
For a graph $G$ the number of edges of $C^j(G$) can be re-written as $f_1(C^j(G)) = f_1(G) + \sum_{k = 0}^ {j-1} f_0(C^k(G))$
\end{Corollary}

If $R_G$ is a random graph, we re-iterate that the $f$-vector of $C^j(R_G)$ will be the basis, after conversion (see \S Bit Conversions for more details), of  a sequence of bits that is to be analyzed by the suite \cite{NIST}.  In previous work \cite{ALDH}, the authors discussed $C^j(R_G)$ and conducted a series of tests using \cite{NIST} verifying that the construction generated families of random bits coming from a random graph.  The implication is that our initial construction preserves this property as new simplicial complexes are ``grown" from the random graph $R_G$.

When reference to a random graph is made, it refers to those graphs described in \cite{ER} and we use the notation $R_G$ to label such.  These graphs have $f$-vectors:  $(f_0, f_1)$ and we assume that $f_1(R_G) \neq 0$.  For the convenience of the reader we list the algorithm implemented in \cite{ALDH} to generate such graphs and to determine the $f$-vector when the cone is applied successively.\\[.5ex]

\begin{center}
\textbf{Random Graph Algorithm}
\end{center}
\begin{algorithmic}
\State Input:  $n$, $p$
\State{Initialize  $M_{ij} = 0 \; \; \forall i, j$} \State {$M_{ij}$ is the $(ij)^{th}$ entry in the  matrix $M$}
\For{ $ i, j =1,\ldots,n$}
\State{ Generate random number $r$} \EndFor
\If{ $r < p$ and $i < j$} \State{ $M_{ij} = 1$} \Else \State {$M_{ij} = 0$} \EndIf
\State{Construct $R_G$ from the matrix $M$}
\end{algorithmic}

In \cite{ALDH} the following algorithm was used to determine the $f$-vector of $C^j(R_G)$:\\[.5ex]

\begin{center}
\textbf{Computing the $f$-vector of the $j^{th}$-cone on $R_G$}
\end{center}


\begin{algorithmic}
\State Input:  Random graph $R_G$
\State{Compute  $\overrightarrow{f}(R_G)$}
\For{ $j =1,\ldots,n$}
\State{Compute  $\overrightarrow{f}(C^{j}(R_G)$} \EndFor
\end{algorithmic}

Observe:  The random graph $R_G$ is generated using the algorithm above and it is fixed, then we compute $\overrightarrow{f}(R_G)$ to initiate the algorithm mentioned above.  Suppose $\overrightarrow{f}(C^{n-1}(R_G)) = (x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_n)$, then $\overrightarrow{f}(C^{n}(R_G)) = (y_0,y_1,\ldots,y_{n+1})$ where for  $ 1\leq i \leq n+1$

\begin{align*}
&y_0     = x_0 + 1  \\
& y_i    = x_{i-1} + x_i  \\
&y_{n+1} = x_n \\
\end{align*}

\section{Dual Polyhedra and Symmetry}
We begin by following the treatment in \cite{B}.  Additional details concerning polytopes and polyhedra can be found there.  For a fixed integer $q >0$ we work in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^q$  and all scalars will be assumed to be real.  Let $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ be points in $\mathbb{R}^q$, then an \textit{affine combination} is the linear combination

$$\sum_{i=1}^n c_ix_i$$

where $c_1 + \cdots + c_n = 1$.  A collection of points is said to be \textit{affinely independent} if $c_1x_1 + \cdots +c_nx_n = 0$ then the $c_i = 0$.  We say a subset $C$ of $\mathbb{R}^q$ is a \textit{convex set} if the following conditions hold for all $x_1, x_2 \in C$ and scalars $c_1$ and $c_2$ satisfying:

\begin{center}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 \in C$ such that $c_1, c_2 \geq 0$.\\
  \item $c_1 + c_2 = 1$
\end{enumerate}
\end{center}


\textit{Affine combinations} are linear combinations where the scalars satisfy the conditions above.  More specifically, let $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ be points in $\mathbb{R}^q$, then a convex combination is a linear combination $c_1x_1+ \cdots + c_nx_n$ such that:

\begin{center}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $c_1 + \cdots + c_n =1$. \\
  \item $c_i \geq 0$
\end{enumerate}
\end{center}

We have the following

\begin{Theorem}
A subset $C$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ is convex if and only if any convex combination of points from $C$ is again in $C$.
\end{Theorem}
\begin{proof}
\cite{B} Pg 11.

   %     \end{minipage}\\

Given a subset $C$ as above, the intersection of all convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^q$ containing it is a convex set denoted by $conv(C)$.  This set is often referred to as the convex hull of $C$. When the set is clear we will simply say the convex hull.

We have the following definition from \cite{B} pg. 44.

\begin{Definition}
A polytope $P$ is the convex hull of a non-empty finite set.
\end{Definition}

Suppose $P = conv(\{ x_1,\ldots,x_n \})$ for points $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^q$, then the dimension of $P$, $dim (P)$ is $k$ if the following conditions hold for a finite number of points $x_1,\ldots,x_k$ from the set $\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$.  First, there is a finite number of points $x_1,\ldots,x_{k+1}$ from the set $\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ that are affinely independent.  Second, there is no such $k+2$ affinely independent points that can be chosen from $\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$.

A vertex of $P$ is a zero dimensional face.  The set of all vertices of $P$ will be denoted by $V(P)$ and $|V(P)|$ will be the cardinality of this set.  Proper faces $F$ of $P$ are polytopes such that $V(F) = F \bigcap Ver(P)$ \cite{B} pg. 45 Theorem 7.3.  Since they are polytopes they have a dimension given by the above.

$P$ can also be regarded as the intersection of finitely many halfspaces in a certain Euclidean space \cite{B, BP1} and such sets are often referred to as \textit{polyhedral sets}.  When the context is clear we will simply refer to $P$ as a polytope.  Given a polytope and a finite collection of halfspaces defining it, a supporting hyperplane is a hyperplane $\mathcal{H}$ such that $P \bigcap \mathcal{H} \neq \emptyset$ where the polytope is contained in one of the halfspaces determined by the hyperplane \cite{BP1}. In this context, a \textit{face} of $P$ is $\mathcal{H} \bigcap P = F$.

Other faces of $P$ include:  $P$, vertices and edges, to name a few.  For a given $P$ its boundary $\partial P = \bigcup_{F \subseteq P} F$.

Given $P$, a facet is a face of dimension $n-1$ and they are often called \textit{codimension one faces}. A $k$-dimensional polytope is called \textit{simple} if each zero face can be written as the intersection of exactly $k$ codimension one faces.  To clarify these points consider the following example, let $P$ be the cube:\\

The codimension one faces are $F_1,\ldots,F_6$ (these are the faces of the cube).  Each edge is the intersection of exactly two faces and these are the codimension two faces.  Each vertex is the intersection of exactly three faces (codimension one faces) and so these are the codimension three faces.  One could equally consider the dimensions of the faces rather than the codimension. In such a case, the faces $F_1,\ldots,F_6$ would be the two dimensional faces, the edges the one-dimensional faces and the vertices the zero-dimensional faces of the cube.


\begin{Example}

Following \cite{BP1}, let $P = \Delta^n$. Then this polytope is $conv( \{x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1} \} )$ where $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^n$.  This is called the \textit{$n$-dimensional simplex} and the points are not on a common affine hyperplane.  This is not to be confused with the simplicial complex $\widehat{\Delta}^n$ whose simplicies are the sets in the power set of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$.  Given $\Delta^n$, then for $i \leq n$, $\Delta^i$ is a face of $P$ of dimension at most $n$. If the points $x_i$ are the unit vectors $e_i$, then $\Delta^n$ is called the \textit{standard n-simplex} \cite{BP1} pg. 8.  For example, in $\mathbb{R}^3$, the standard 2-simplex is the convex hull of the unit vectors $e_1, e_2$ and $e_3$.  A picture can be found below:\\

We now follow the treatment in \cite{DJ}-specifically pages 425 and 430.  The main idea is that given a polytope one may construct a simplicial complex dual to it and vice-versa.  Assume $P$ is an $n$-dimensional simple polytope (defined as above) and let $\Im = \{F_0,\ldots,F_m\}$ be the set of facets.  Let $\mathcal{K}_P$ denote the dual simplicial complex with vertex set $\{F_0,\ldots,F_m\}$ with the requirement:  $\sigma = \{ F_0,\ldots,F_{j}\}$ span a $j+1$ simplex in $\mathcal{K}_P$ if and only if $ F_0 \cap \cdots \cap F_j \neq \emptyset$ in $P$.  We observe that a zero face in $P$ (a vertex) is a codimension $n$ face; hence, it is the intersection of exactly $n$ facets.  By the definition of the dual, such an intersection spans an $n-1$ simplex.  Therefore, the dual complex $\mathcal{K}_P$ is $(n-1)$-dimensional.  Furthermore, it is a simplicial sphere, roughly meaning, it is essentially a combinatorial representation of the sphere $S^{n-1}$.


\begin{Notation}
We fix the notation regarding the dual.  Given a simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$ we will write the dual as $P$ (or $P_{\mathcal{K}}$ if we need to stress certain properties of this combinatorial object).  When convenient we may just say ``the dual".  If $P$ is given, then the dual, $\mathcal{K}_P$ will be written as $\mathcal{K}$ when there is no room for confusion.  For reasons of convenience certain authors use the notation $\mathcal{K}^*$ to denote the dual, especially when considering $\mathcal{K}^{**}$ (\cite{G}), but we will stick with the conventions mentioned above.  Given $\mathcal{K}$ the notation $P_{\mathcal{K}}$ is used in the paper \cite{DJ}.

If $F$ is a codimcension one face of the cube (a face of the cube) we let $v_F$ denote the dual vertex in $\mathcal{K}_{P^3}$. Recall, the codimension one faces of the cube dualize to vertices, so each face of the cube dualizes to a vertex $v_{F_i}$.  Each codimension two face in the cube is the intersection of two faces (e.g., $F_1 \bigcap F_6 = E$ where $E$ is an edge in $P$) dualizes to an edge.  In this very specific example $F_1 \bigcap F_6$ dualizes to the edge $\{v_{F_1}, v_{F_6}\}$.  Finally, a vertex in the cube is a codimension three face since it is the intersection of three facets.  Here, the vertex $v_1$ in the cube is the intersection:  $F_2 \bigcap F_3\bigcap F_5$ so it dualizes to $\{v_{F_2}, v_{F_3}, v_{F_5}\} $  The table below lists the simplicies in the dual two-dimensional simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}_{P^3}$.

\end{Example}

In the case that a simplicial complex is a simplicial sphere, then the construction can made to generate a simple polytope.  Since the zero simplicies in $\mathcal{K}$ are dual to codimension one faces in the dual polytope, the face structure of the polytope is given by working through higher dimensional simplicies of $K$ and carefully fitting together the faces of the polytope using the definition of the simplicial complex along with the process to dualize.

If $K$ is a general simplicial complex then it is possible to construct a simple polyhedral complex \cite{DJ} pg. 428. This involves the notion of a cone on the geometric realization of various posets.

Later we will consider $\mathcal{K} = C^j(R_G)$ (for some positive integer $j$) and then analyze certain inequalities derived from the $g$-theorem.  To do so requires the analysis of the \textit{$h$-vector} (denoted $\overrightarrow{h}$) of the dual and how it is related to the $\overrightarrow{f}$ of the simplicial complex we construct.  Following \cite{DJ} pg. 430 we have:


%Given a simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$ and its dual $\mathcal{K^*}$ there are associated vectors
%that encode the face structure, namely, $\overrightarrow{h}$ and the $\overrightarrow{f}$.

\begin{Definition}
Let $(f_0,\ldots,f_{n-1})$ be the $f$-vector of an $(n-1)$-dimensional simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$. Then the $h$-vector of the dual, $(h_0, h_1,\ldots,h_n)$, is defined by the following equation:

$$h_0t^n + \cdots+ h_{n-1}t + h_n  = (t-1)^n + f_0(t-1)^{n-1} + \cdots + f_{n-1}$$

\end{Definition}

Observe that the number of components in the $h$-vector is the dimension of $\mathcal{K}$ plus one.  In the case that $K$ (simplicial sphere) is dual to $P$ as above, then by \cite{DJ}, $f_i(K)$ is the number of codimension $i+1$ faces of $P$ (or $n-i-1$ faces). From \cite{BP1} pg. 12 there are the following two compact equations that relate specific components of the $\overrightarrow{h}$ and $\overrightarrow{f}$.  For $k = 0,...,n$
we have:\\

\begin{center}
$$h_k = \sum_{i = 0}^k (-1)^{k-i}\binom{n-i}{n-k}f_{i-1}$$
\end{center}

and
\begin{center}
$$f_{n-1-k} = \sum_{q = k}^n \binom{q}{k}h_{n-q}$$
\end{center}

\begin{Example}

Let $\mathcal{K}$ have the following $f$-vector  $(4,4)$.  Referring to Example \ref{Dual Square} it is a square.  The claim is that the dual $P$ has corresponding $h$-vector:  $(1,2,1)$.  Specifically, $h_0 =1 = h_2$ and $h_1 =2$.  We have the polynomial $h_0t^2 + h_1t+h_2 = (t-1)^2 + f_0(t-1) + f_1$.  Expanding and equating coefficients produces $h_0 =  1$, $h_1 = f_0 -2$ and $h_2 = f_1 - f_0 +1$ and we obtain the vector above.

\end{Example}

For certain types of simplicial complexes the $h$-vector of the dual exhibits a symmetry exhibited by Dehn-Sommerville relations.   From \cite{BP1}

\begin{Theorem}\label{Dehn}
The $h$-vector of any simple $n$-polytope is symmetric $h_{n-i} = h_i$ for $i = 0,1,\ldots,n$
\end{Theorem}


\begin{Example}
For a positive integer $n > 1$ let  $P = \Delta^n$ then $h_i(P) = 1$ for $i =0,\ldots,n$.  This follows from \cite{BP1} along with a simple verification using Theorem \ref{Dehn}. For each $i < n-1$, the $h$-vectors of the proper faces $ \Delta^i$ and $ \Delta^{i+1}$ have components all consisting of ones and the $h$-vector of $ \Delta^{i+1}$ has one more component then the $h$-vector of $ \Delta^i$.  More specifically, consider $\Delta^2$; it has $h$-vector $(1,1,1)$.  Now $\Delta^1$ is a face and has $h$-vector $(1,1)$.  We state the following interesting fact from \cite{DJ} and observe that for the examples listed here, the following equation holds.

$$h_0 + \cdots+ h_n = |V(P)|$$

\end{Example}

Recall, $R_G$ is a random graph generated using the methods described in \cite{ALDH} and the simplicial complex $\mathcal{K} = C^j(R_G)$ is the $j^{th}$-cone on $R_G$. A fundamental question we seek to answer is the following; given $\mathcal{K} = C^j(R_G)$ and $\overrightarrow{f}(\mathcal{K})$ what type of symmetry does this $f$-vector exhibit? Another interesting formulation of this question is to determine if the dual polytope is simple or not.  Fortunately, the celebrated \textit{$g$-theorem} provides an answer for a fairly general class of polyhedra. Using \cite{B} we note that the $f$-vector of $P$ has components $f_i$ and they equal the number of $i$-faces of $P$.  So using this convention, if $P$ is simple and $n$-dimensional, then the $f$-vector is $(f_0,...,f_{n-1})$ where $f_0$ is the number of vertices of $P$ and $f_{n-1}$ is the number of facets of $P$.

The following material can be found in \cite{B} pgs. 130-131 and we list it here for the convenience of the reader.  Let $g_i(f) := \sum_{j=0}^d (-1)^{i+j}\binom{j}{i}f_j$ for $i = 0,..,d$.  Let $m: = \lfloor \frac{d-1}{2}\rfloor$ and $n: = \lfloor \frac{d}{2} \rfloor$.  The following is referred to as McMullen's Conditions \cite{B}, but other authors refer to it as the $g$-theorem \cite{BP1}.  For additional information regarding condition $(3)$ the interested reader can refer to \cite{B} pg. 130 (specifically, (2)-(4)).

\begin{Theorem}\label{MM condition}
A $d$-tuple $(f_0,...,f_{d-1})$ of positive integers is the $f$-vector of a simple $d$-polytope if and only if the following conditions hold:

\begin{center}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $g_i(f) = g_{d-i}(f)$ for $i = 0,..,m$.
  \vspace{.1in}
  \item $g_i(f) \leq g_{i+1}(f)$ for $i = 0,..,n-1$.
  \vspace{.1in}
  \item $g_{i+1}(f) - g_{i}(f) \leq (g_i(f) - g_{i-1}(f))^{\langle i\rangle}$ for $i = 1,...,n-1$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{center}

\end{Theorem}

Theorem \ref{MM condition} encodes information regarding upper and lower bounds on the number of faces of simple polytopes.  From \cite{B} pg. 132 one equation that can be derived is the following:

\begin{center}
$ f_0 = \sum_{i=0}^d \binom{i}{0}g_i(f)$
\end{center}

\vspace{.1in}
This can be written as $f_0 = (d-1)f_{d-1} - (d+1)(d-2)$ and to clarify that this equation refers to the polytope $P$ we will write

\begin{center}
$f_0(P) = (d-1)f_{d-1}(P) - (d+1)(d-2)$
\end{center}

%$f_1 \leq \binom{f_0}{2}$ is equivalent to item $(3)$ in the $g$-Theorem for $i= 1$. For the applications in this paper, this particular upper bound is not sufficient to prove that the $f$-vectors we produce are sufficiently complicated.  Referring to \cite{BP1} we will analyze the inequality $f_1 \geq nf_0 - \binom{n+1}{2}$ and ultimately show that we can construct simplicial complexes for which it fails to hold.

\begin{Remark}
It is important to note that the generated random graph is fixed.  Therefore, the terms $f_0(R_G)$ and $f_1(R_G)$ are fixed, but the parameter $j$ can grow and this is the number of times the cone operation is performed.
\end{Remark}

To apply the $g$-theorem it is critical that we understand the dimension of the simplicial complex that results from applying the cone.  We recall that $C^j(R_G)$ is a $(j+1)$-dimensional simplicial complex when $f_1(R_G) \neq 0$.

%Assuming that the random graph has $m$ vertices we observe that $\sum_{j = 0}^ {n-1} f_0(C^j(R_G)) = m(n-1) + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ because it is the sum of $n-1$ successive integers starting at $m$.

\begin{Lemma}\label{f vector cone}
Let $\mathcal{K}$ be an $(n-1)$-dimensional simplicial complex with given $\overrightarrow{f}(\mathcal{K}) = (f_0,\ldots,f_{n-1})$.  For a positive integer $j > 0$ the following holds: $f_{n+j -1}(C^j(\mathcal{K})) = f_{n-1}(\mathcal{K})$\\
\end{Lemma}

%For some positive integer $i$ suppose there are $f_{n-1} = i$ such simplicies in $\mathcal{K}$.

\begin{proof}
Let $\sigma_{max} = \{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}$ be a top dimensional simplex in $\mathcal{K}$ noting that $dim(\mathcal{K}) = |  \sigma_{max} | -1$.    We observe that $C(\mathcal{K})$ has the effect of adding one vertex to each simplex, but in particular for a $\sigma_{max}^{'} \in C(\mathcal{K})$ we have $\sigma_{max}^{'} = \sigma_{max} \cup \{c_1\}$ where $c_1$ refers to the new vertex added to the simplex, the cone point, and $\sigma_{max}$ is a simplex counted in $f_{n-1}(\mathcal{K})$.  Clearly, $| \sigma_{max}^{'}|  = |\sigma_{max}| + 1 = n+1$ and there are $f_{n-1}$ such simplicies.  Furthermore, it is obvious that the dimension of $C(\mathcal{K})$ is $n$.  Similarly, for $j >1$ we have $dim(C^j(\mathcal{K})) = dim(\mathcal{K}) + j = n + j -1$.  Each top dimensional simplex in the iterated cone $C^j(\mathcal{K})$ are those that are the top dimensional simplicies in $\mathcal{K}$ with $j$ vertices added coming from adjoining $j$ ``cone" points.  These maximal dimensional simplicies have $n+j$ vertices and so the top component of $\overrightarrow{f}(C^j(\mathcal{K}))$ is $f_{n+j-1}$ and such simplicies are enumerated by $f_{n-1}(\mathcal{K})$.
\end{proof}

\begin{Remark}
 Of particular interest is the case $\mathcal{K} = R_G$ such that $f_1(R_G) \neq 0$.  The equation above, then takes the form:$f_{j+1}(C^j(R_G)) = f_1(R_G)$ noting that $f_{j+1}$ is the component of the $f$-vector enumerating the simplicies of maximal cardinality.
\end{Remark}

%For an $n$-dimensional simple polytope, $f_i(P)$ counts the number of codimension $(i+1)$-faces of $P$ \cite{BP1} pg.12.  This comes from the fact that such $f$-vectors are defined in terms of the $f$-vectors of the duals.

\begin{Proposition}\label{No g Theorem}
For a graph $G$ such that $f_1(G) \neq 0$, let $C^{j}(G) = \mathcal{K}^{j+1}$. For $j$ sufficiently large, the complexes $\mathcal{K}^{j+1}$ are not dual to a polytope that satisfies the $g$-theorem.
\end{Proposition}

\begin{proof}

Given a fixed graph $G$ let $f_0(G) = s$ and $f_1(G) = t$.  We argue by contradiction.  Suppose for all $j$ we have $\mathcal{K}^{j+1}$ is dual to a $(j+2)$-dimensional polytope $P$ that satisfies the $g$-theorem.  Then the following equation must hold where $d = dim(P)$:

\begin{center}
$f_0(P) = (d-1)f_{d-1}(P) - (d+1)(d-2)$
\end{center}

Since $f_{j+1}$ is the number of codimension one faces of $P$ we obtain, using the dual complex, $f_{j+1}(P) = s+j$.  Plugging all of this into the equation above
gives:

\begin{center}
$\displaystyle \frac{t-s}{s-2} = j$
\end{center}

To obtain the result observe that the left hand side of the equation is fixed and $j$ can be arbitrarily large.



\end{proof}

Proposition \ref{No g Theorem} also implies that one can pass through the class of simple $n$ polytopes. As a practical matter this is crucial in ensuring that the $f$-vectors do not exhibit a symmetry as described by the statements that follow, in particular Definition \ref{symmetrical}.  One goal is to maintain the computational complexity of the resulting $f$-vector \cite{KP}.

Let $P = \Delta^n$ and $\mathcal{K}_P = \mathcal{K}$ be its dual. It is shown that when $\overrightarrow{h}(P) = (1,1,\ldots,1)$, then $\overrightarrow{f}(\mathcal{K})$ satisfies a Dehn-Sommerville type relationship.

Let us recall Pascal's Triangle:

\large
$$
\begin{tikzpicture}
\foreach \n in {0,...,4} {
  \foreach \k in {0,...,\n} {
    \node at (\k-\n/2,-\n) {${\n \choose \k}$};
  }
}
\end{tikzpicture}
$$
\normalsize

We note that the triangle starts from row zero and the entry $\binom{n}{k}$ refers to row $n$ column $k$. The $n^{th}$ row
in the triangle is


$$\bigg \{ \binom{n}{r} \; \bigg | \;  0 \leq r \leq n \bigg \}$$

There is a zeroth row and it contains $\binom{0}{0}$ and for each row there are columns starting at zero.  For example, row two contains: $\binom{2}{0}$, $\binom{2}{1}$ and $\binom{2}{2}$.  Using this notational convention, there are three columns whereby $\binom{2}{0}$ is in column zero for this row.  There are diagonals too and they begin with the zeroth diagonal consisting of $\binom{y}{0}$ for positive integers $y \geq 0$.

For the convenience of the reader we recall the following.  For $k = 0,\ldots,n$
we have:\\

$$h_k = \sum_{i = 0}^k (-1)^{k-i}\binom{n-i}{n-k}f_{i-1}$$

\vspace{.1in}
$$f_{n-1-k} = \sum_{q = k}^n \binom{q}{k}h_{n-q}$$

\begin{Definition}\label{symmetrical}
An $n-1$ dimensional simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$ is called symmetrical if $f_j(\mathcal{K}) = f_{n-j-1}(\mathcal{K})$ for $0 \leq j \leq n-1$.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Theorem} \label{N simplex}
Let $n >1$ and suppose $P$ is an $n$-dimensional simple convex polytope such that $\overrightarrow{h}(P) = (1,\ldots,1)$, then the $n-1$ dimensional dual simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$ is symmetrical.  % let $\overrightarrow{f}(K)$ be the $f$-vector of the dual.  Then $f_j(K) = f_{n-(j+1)}(K)$ for $ 0 \leq j \leq n-1$.
\end{Theorem}

\begin{proof}
We assume $n$ is fixed.  Since $h_i = 1$ for each $i$, then for $0 \leq k \leq n$ the components of the
$f$-vector of $\mathcal{K}$ can be written as:

$$f_{n-1-k} = \sum_{q = k}^n \binom{q}{k}$$\\

We first deal with the extreme cases for $k$. If $k = n$, then it is clear that $f_{-1} = 1$.  For $k = 0$, then

$$f_{n-1} = \sum_{q = 0}^n \binom{q}{0} = n+1$$\\

By similar calculations we obtain for $k = n-1$:

$$f_0 = \binom{n-1}{n-1} + \binom{n}{n-1}$$\\

Hence, $f_0 = f_{n-1} = n+1$.  In what follows we will use certain summations in Pascal's triangle.  Generally, consider a set $\{0,\ldots,t\}$ of consecutive positive integers.  Fix $s \in \{0,\ldots,t\}$ such that $s \leq t $ then using the $f$-vector calculation above we have the summation:

$$f_{t-1-s} = \binom{s}{s} + \binom{s+1}{s} +\binom{s+2}{s} + \cdots + \binom{t}{s}$$\\

This is summation along a diagonal in Pascal's Triangle, therefore

$$f_{t-1-s} = \binom{t+1}{s+1}$$\\

Consider $f_{n-1-k}$ and the two substitutions for $k$ (observe that $t = n$ and $s = k$ in the formulation above):\\
\begin{enumerate}
  \item When $ k = j$, then $f_{n-1-j} =\displaystyle \binom{n+1}{j+1}$.\\
  \item When $ k= n-j-1$, then $f_{n-1-j} = \displaystyle\binom{n+1}{n-j}$.\\
\end{enumerate}

To complete the proof one must show that $\binom{n+1}{j+1} = \binom{n+1}{n-j}$, but this follows immediately from the properties of $n$ choose $k$.

\end{proof}

We note that the $\overrightarrow{h}$ has a component $h_n$ but the entries of the dual $(n-1)$ dimensional complex are located in the $n+1$ row in Pascal's Triangle.  The following statement follows immediately from Theorem \ref{N simplex} and the tests found in sections \S\ref{results} and \S\ref{appendix}. %\textcolor{red}{add section for the results showing that the test suite does not see these bit sequences}.

\begin{Remark}
There are families of bit sequences that are derived from symmetrical simplicial complexes and their successive cones that are determined to be random using the NIST test suite described in publication 800-22~\cite{NIST}.
The key takeaway is that one starts with a combinatorial object with a clear pattern (symmetry) and dualizing it produces a simplicial complex that is highly symmetrical, yet the converted bit sequence shows up as random using the NIST test suite. More is true, using the cone it is possible to construct arbitrarily many bit sequences (derived from this symmetrical object) that the test suite deems random.
\end{Remark}

\section{Bit Conversions} \label{bitconversions}

The experimental implementation uses arbitrary-sized integers to represent vector components, then this vector is converted into a sequence of integers.
Since the NIST test suite \cite{NIST} expects its input to be a binary file, we must convert a sequence of integers into the corresponding binary bit-stream.
To do this we, iterate over the vector components to generate a binary representation of each integer.  We then concatenate this binary representation onto the output file.  Care must be taken; it is important to use a bit-wise approach instead of a byte-wise approach.  In a byte-wise approach, the binary representation of each integer will begin on a byte boundary, and since most integers will not completely fill their most-significant byte, there will be up to 7 extraneous leading zero bits.  In practice, this means that the binary representations of each integer should be bit-shifted before concatenation, to avoid these leading zero bits.

To illustrate the importance of this point, our initial implementation in~\cite{ALDH} has a minor bug in the bit-shifting code that is only triggered for certain byte values, and when triggered drops a 0-bit from the output stream.
Despite the relative rarity of this bug being triggered, the NIST test suite did detect its non-random contributions to the output file, as can be seen in Tables 1, 3, 13, and 15 in~\cite{ALDH}, which show a noticeable ``clustering'' effect towards $p$-values of 0. In the current implementation used in this paper this bug has been fixed.

\section{Results} \label{results}

% We include two sets of probability-distribution graphs in this section.
% Each graph shows the results of one major test from the NIST test suite run on 100 different data sets generated using the cone operation, with the data set number on the x-axis, and the NIST test suite's corresponding $p$-value on the y-axis.
% There are twelve major tests in the suite, and therefore each set contains twelve graphs.
% A non-random pattern should be consistently detected by the test suite and shown with every data set having a $p$-value of close to 1.0 or close to 0.0, which will appear as a ``clustering'' of points towards the top or bottom of the graph.
% The test suite requires at least 10 megabits of input data, which requires around 3750 coning operations when starting from a two-element $f$-vector.

% The first set of 12 graphs therefore shows the results of running the NIST test suite's 12 major tests on 100 different data sets

\sloppy
The algorithms described in the previous section allow us to perform a particular operation on a simplicial complex; hence changing its $f$-vector.  These vectors will increase in size incrementally and they can be computed since very explicitly, although this is a difficult problem in general.  Although it might be possible to start with a large arbitrary vector as our initial input, we have, by our construction a method to generate bit sequences using a combinatorial construction.  The resulting vectors are converted to a stream of bits, which we then use as input to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) statistical test suite. You can download the suite at the following url:  \url{https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Random-Bit-Generation/Documentation-and-Software}

The suite requires a bit-stream input from a random number generator that contains at least 10 megabits of input data. For each bit-stream, the NIST test suite will output a report that shows the $p$-values associated with each of the tests within the suite.

%Rerunning experiments using version 2.0 of the code.
Recall, one theme of the paper is to demonstrate that the NIST test suite cannot detect certain non-random sequences that arise from combinatorial constructions. We conducted three experiments on certain vectors.  They are: the $h$-vector and variants of its length, the number of cones applied to the dual simplicial complex and the bits associated to the components of the $h$-vector. Our first experiment follows these steps:

%We explored the effect of symmetry in $h$-vectors on the resulting dual $f$-vectors. To this end, we ran three sets of experiments as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Step 1:  Create an $h$-vector consisting of all ones coming from the standard $n$-simplex, $\Delta^n$.
\item Step 2:  Compute the $f$-vector of the dual $\mathcal{K}$ corresponding to $\Delta^n$ and its $h$-vector from the previous step.
\item Step 3:  Compute the iterated cone, $C^k(\mathcal{K})$, for $ 0 \leq k \leq q$ and for some $q$ and the resulting $f$-vector for experiment one listed above.
\item Run the resulting bit sequence (bit-stream) from Step 3 through the NIST test suite.
\end{enumerate}

%\textcolor{red}{Insert some pics that describe random versus non-random as mentioned in my email}


A non-random pattern should be consistently detected by the NIST test suite and shown with every data set having a $p$-value close to 1.0 or 0.0.  This will  appear as a ``clustering'' of points towards the top or bottom of the graph represented as a flatline (See Figure~\ref{fig:random} and ~\ref{fig:nonrandom}). These sparklines represent the trend of all NIST tests for different variations of the input $h$-vectors.

The time required to run these tests on a modern consumer CPU (Intel Core i5-4590) was originally 2.3 ~\cite{ALDH}. However, performance of the code improved due to optimizations and algorithmic improvements. Updated and improved results from ~\cite{ALDH} can be found in the Appendix~\ref{second-appendix}.

For the first experiment, fix an $h$-vector of length 3751 consisting of all ones. So this is the $h$-vector of $\Delta^{3751}$.  Proceed to steps 2 and 3 and apply the cone to the dual simplicial complex then compute its $f$-vector.  Vary the number of coning operations from 0 to 99 times on the dual complex $\mathcal{K}$ for $0 \leq k \leq 99$ ( figure~\ref{fig:conings}) in Appendix~\ref{first-appendix}.  The sample scatter plots on Figures~\ref{fig:approxentropy21},~\ref{fig:linearcomplexity21} and~\ref{fig:rank21}, show the $p$-value distributions.  The graphs show that the NIST test suite is unable to detect non-randomness.   %    '-p 3751 -f -c 0 -b' through '-p 3751 -f -c 99 -b'

\indent For the second experiment, we computed the $f$-vector dual to the $h$-vector without applying the cone to the dual (or iterated cone). We vary the $h$-vector length from 3750 to 3849. So, we have a collection of $h$-vectors all of whose components are ones corresponding to a set of standard simplicies:  $\{\Delta^i \;| \; 3750 \leq i \leq 3849\}$.  This should serve as a benchmark since there are no random processes involved that may result from the iterated coning operation. Furthermore, we expect the NIST suite to indicate that the bit-stream is non-random. However, the NIST test suite is unable to detect the non-randomness as illustrated in the sparklines in Figure~\ref{fig:lengths} in Appendix~\ref{first-appendix}.  We have also included sample scatter plots for the Approximate Entropy test (Figure~\ref{fig:approxentropy22}), the Linear Complexity test (Figure~\ref{fig:linearcomplexity22}) and the Rank test (Figure~\ref{fig:rank22}).  %  '-p 3750 -f -b' through '-p 3849 -f -b'

\indent Motivated by the failure of the NIST test suite to detect non-random phenomena we conducted a third experiment. Some terminology is needed.  Given an $h$-vector $(h_0,...,h_n)$ define \textit{end elements} to be $h_0$ and $h_n$ whilst, \textit{non-end} elements are those $h_i$ such that $i \neq 0,n$.
For $\Delta^{3750}$ fix the corresponding $h$-vector.  Vary the non-end elements in the vector from 1 to 100. This must be done in a manner where the Dehn-Sommerville relations are preserved (see Theorem 4.9) as a necessary, but not sufficient condition for the vector to correspond to a polytope.  We observe that the construction is general and allows for components of the resulting vector to have non-end points to be any integer so long as the two end elements are 1, but for the purposes of testing, we restrict to integers between 1 and 100.  We are not claiming that the resulting vector is the $h$ of a polytope.  Indeed, other condition(s) would have to hold for this to be true.  From a testing perspective, this ad-hoc method allows for additional bit generation.  Moreover, for those vectors that correspond to polytopes, the construction allows for additional vectors to be created by dualizing and computing the $f$-vector.  Some examples of varied non-end elements can be found below:    % from 1 to 100 literally means creating the following $h$-vectors:


\begin{itemize}

\item[] 1 1 1 \ldots 1 1 1

%WHAT IS THIS STUFF?
%
%
%


%
%We argue by contradiction.  Suppose $K^{j+2}$ is dual to a $j+3$ dimensional simple convex polytope $P$, then the vertices of $K^{j+2}$ are the codimension one faces of $P$ and proceeding with the dualization; we determine that the simplicies of maximal dimension in $K^{j+2}$ correspond to the vertices of $P$.  Since $f_0(P)$ is the number of vertices of $P$, it follows that $f_0(P) = f_1(R_G)$ by Lemma \ref{f vector cone}.  If the $g$-Theorem were true then the inequality
%
%
%$$f_0(P) \geq j+4$$\\
%
%must hold (\cite{BP1} pg. 16 Example 1.30).  However, $f_1(R_G)$ is fixed and $j$ is sufficiently large.  We arrive at a contradiction and the result follows.
%
%Before we conclude this section, we define an operation between simplicial complexes which will be important for us later. Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the set of simplicial complexes of finite dimension.
%
%\begin{Definition}\label{operation}
%Given $\mathcal{S}$, an operation $\theta$ is a function  $\theta:\mathcal{S}  \to \mathcal{S}$.
%\end{Definition}
%
%We observe that $\theta$ takes as input a simplicial complex and assigns to it a simplicial complex.  There is no requirement on the dimension, nor are there any requirements that simplicies map to simplicies.  That is, we do not require $\theta$ to be a simplicial map.  We take note that those operations for which $\theta(\mathcal{K}) = \mathcal{K}$ are called \textit{trivial operations}. We now give examples of operations:

%
%
%
%
%We refer to \cite{B} page 44 and start with the definition of a \textit{convex polytope} which is the convex hull of finitely many points in some Euclidean space (compare with \cite{BP1} pg. 7). Suppose $P$ = convex hull of $\{x_1,....,x_k\}$ with $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^j$ then the \textit{dimension of P} is $k$.  In $\mathbb{R}^2$, consider the halfspace:
%
%\begin{center}
%$H_{(x,r)} = \{y \in \mathbb{R}^2 \; | \langle x,y \rangle \geq r \}$.
%\end{center}
%
%Here, the $r$ is a fixed real number and $x$ is a fixed vector.  So, the halfspace consists of all of those vectors $y$ where the inner product
%satisfies the inequality $\langle x,y \rangle \geq r$.  To illustrate, consider the following case
%
%\begin{Example}
%Let $x = (1,0)$ and $r = 2$, then
%\begin{center}
%$H_{(x,2)} = \{(y_1,y_2) \; | y_1 \geq 2 \}$
%\end{center}
%
%\textcolor{red}{Insert picture here for this case}
%
%\end{Example}https://www.overleaf.com/project/6027e328b116736fc4a191d7
%
%
%
%provides an explicit method to construct
%simplicial complexes that are not \textit{simple convex polytopes}.  To prove this we explicitly relate the face structure of the underlying random
%graph to the dimension of the ``grown" complex via the construction in \cite{ALDH}.  From here, we analyze certain inequalities that result from
%the $g$-theorem.  Finally, we show that for a sufficiently large number of iterations of our constrcution, the resulting simplicial complex is dual
%to a polyhedron that is \textbf{not} a simple convex polytope.  Inequalities describing this outcome are derived and used in the testing regime.
%
%\indent As an application, the derived inequalities are used to control the simlpicial complexes we wish to construct and test.  Namely,
%in specific dimensions the generated simplcial complexes are known to be dual to polyhedra that are in fact simple convex polytopes and these
%polyhedra have $h$-vectors that exhibit a high degree of symmetry given by the Dehn-sommerville relations ($h_i = h_{n-i})$ where the parameter
%$n$ depends on the dimension of the polytope and the number of times the construction is iterated.  The implication is that
%the dual complex also exhibits a certain symmetry as encoded by its $$f$-vector$ (since the $h$ and $f$ vectors determine each other).
%Most importantly, from a testing perspective, the complexes generated from this process appear to be random from the NIST testing suite.
%As such, the tests in \cite{NIST} fail to detect the patterns expressed by the $g$-theorem.
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
%We have the following concerning lower bounds.
%
%\begin{Theorem}\label{lower boud}
%Given $R_G$ and a positive integer $j$ sufficiently large, then $C^{j+1}(R_G)$ is not a $j+2$ simplicial polytope.
%\end{Theorem}
%
%\begin{proof}
%Let $R_G$ be a fixed random graph with $f_0(R_G) = m$.  We first observe that the dimension of $C^{j+1}(R_G)$ is $j+2$ and we assume it is $j+2$ simplicial.  By \cite{BP1} pg. 19 Theorem 1.37
%then the following inequality must hold
%
%\begin{center}
%
%$f_{j+1}(C^{j+1}(R_G) \geq (j+1)f_0(C^{j+1}(R_G)) - (j+3)(j)$\\
%
%\end{center}
%
%By Lemma \ref{f vector cone} we obtain the inequality
%
%\begin{center}
%$f_1(R_G) \geq (j+1)(m+j+1)  - (j+3)(j)$\\
%\end{center}
%
%By algebra we obtain the inequality
%
%\begin{center}
%$f_1(R_G) - m - 1  \geq j(m-1) $\\
%\end{center}
%
%Since $f_1(R_G)$ and $m$ are fixed we obtain a contradiction.  Hence, $C^{j+1}(R_G)$ is not a $j+2$ simplicial polytope.
%
%\end{proof}
%
%
%\begin{Remark}
%In Theorem \ref{lower bound} the random graph is not dualized to produce a polytope.  In fact, in the statement
%the components, $f_i$ of the $f$-vector measures the number of $i$ dimensional faces.

%Let $\mathcal{K}_{n}$ be the set of $n$-dimensional simplicies of $\mathcal{K}$.  For $n \geq 0$, let $(\mathcal{K} \ast \mathcal{L})_n$
%denote the $n$-dimensional simplicies in  $\mathcal{K} \ast \mathcal{L}$.  We have the following decomposition
%using the join:
%
%\vspace{.1in}
%$(\mathcal{K} \ast \mathcal{L})_n = \mathcal{K}_n  \cup \mathcal{L}_n \cup (\mathcal{K}_{n-1} \ast \mathcal{L}_0) \cup (\mathcal{K}_{n-2} \ast \mathcal{L}_1) \cup \cdot \cdot \cdot \cup (\mathcal{K}_0 \ast \mathcal{L}_{n-1})$
%
%
%Of particular interest is the case of computing the $f$-vector of the $k$-join of $\Delta^n$ with $R_G$.  For computational
% purposes we write the join recursively as $(\Delta_1^n \ast (\Delta_2^n \ast \cdots\ast  \Delta_k^n) \ast R_G)$.  To compute the
% $f$-vector it will suffice to apply Lemma \ref{p join calculation}.
%
%\begin{Theorem}
%$$f_j(\Delta_1^n \ast (\Delta_2^n \ast \cdots \ast  \Delta_k^n) \ast R_G) =$$
%$$ f_j(\Delta_1^n) + f_j((\Delta_2^n \ast \cdots \ast  \Delta_k^n) \ast R_G)) + \sum_{k= 0}^{j-1}f_K(\Delta_1^n)f_{j-1-k}((\Delta_2^n \ast \cdots \ast  \Delta_k^n) \ast R_G))$$
%\end{Theorem}
%
%
%\textcolor{red}{Redo the next example there is a third component.  There is an $f_3$ on each term}
%\begin{Example}
%To illustrate, we compute the third component of the $f$-vector for the $k = 3$ join with the notational convention $\Delta^n = \Delta$
%\begin{align*}
%f_3((\Delta \ast (\Delta \ast \Delta \ast R_G))) &= f_3(\Delta) + f_3(\Delta \ast \Delta \ast R_G) \\
%& + f_0(\Delta)f_2(\Delta \ast \Delta \ast R_G)  \\
%&+f_1(\Delta)f_1(\Delta \ast \Delta \ast R_G) \\
%&+f_2(\Delta)f_0(\Delta \ast \Delta \ast R_G)
%\end{align*}\\
%
%We can continue to expand the terms.  For example, in the above
%
%\begin{align*}
%f_3(\Delta \ast \Delta \ast R_G) &= f_3(\Delta) + f_3(\Delta \ast R_G) \\
%& + f_0(\Delta)f_2(\Delta \ast R_G)  \\
%&+f_1(\Delta)f_1(\Delta \ast  R_G) \\
%&+f_2(\Delta)f_0(\Delta \ast  R_G)
%\end{align*}\\
%
%For illustrative purposes we expand the term $f_3 (\Delta \ast R_G)$ in the equation above noting that
%$f_2(R_G) = 0$
%
%  \begin{align*}
%f_3(\Delta \ast R_G) &= f_3(\Delta) + f_1(\Delta)f_1(R_G)  +f_2(\Delta)f_0(R_G)
%\end{align*}\\
%\end{Example}
%
% Each product in the sum encodes all possible ways a certain simplex can be constructed and the count comes from the multiplication principle.
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
%Let $f_0= m$ be the number of vertices of the random graph $R_G$ and assume without loss of generality that $f_1 \neq 0 $.  Recall, $n$
%is the number of times the cone is formed.  From
%\cite{BP1} pg. 16, Theorem 1.29 part (c) the following inequality must hold if the $f$-vector is realized by a simple $n$-polytope:
%$f_1 \leq \binom{f_0}{2}$.  The first component of the $f$ vector corresponding to $C^n(R_G)$ has terms:  $nm + f_1 + x$ where $x$ is a term
%that is derived recursively.  To obtain a gross lower bound and to simplify the calculation we assume that $x$ is zero (which it is not).  With the restrictions on the components of the $f$-vector stated above, we obtain the inequality
%$nm + f_1 \leq m(m-2)$.  After combining terms, performing some basic algebra and equating coefficients we determine the inequality
%holds if $n+2 \leq m$ and the result follows.  The case $f_1 =0$ (i.e., $R_G$ is the disjoint union of $m$ vertices) follows trivially
%using a simplified version of the argument above.
%
%
%
%\section{Algorithm}
%Let us recall the main idea behind the one-time pad.  Given a message $m_l$ of length $l$ to encode, a sequence of random integers $a_1,\ldots,a_l$ is generated.  Each letter is encoded using the sum with an integer from the list $a_1,\ldots,a_l$.  The encoded message takes the form: $\widetilde{a}_1 + \widetilde{a}_1,...., \widetilde{a}_l + \widetilde{a}_l$. This message is sent to the receiver along with the key.  Observe that the key is the same length as the message and both, must be transferred to the receiver.  Once received, the message can be decoded by simply subtracting out the appropriate integer in the key.  It is also the case that a one-time pad encrypts by working over $\mathbb{Z}_2$.  In this case the ciphertext is decoded by summing it with the key.  Of course, each random integer in the list is used once and only once. It is well-known that the one-time pad is secure.
%
%We will mimic the main idea behind a one-time pad using combinatorial methods.  However, our algorithm exhibits a degree of compression that is lacking in the one-time pad.  For example, the algorithm requires the transfer of a key whose length is smaller than the length of the encoded message.  Furthermore, the proposed algorithm allows for publishing operations (elaborate on the public
%key notions later...)
%
%In this section we will describe the algorithm that will be used to generate an encryption key.  \\
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item  Randomly select an integer $m$ and a point $p$ in the interval $(0,1)$.\\
%\item  Generate an Erdos-Renyi random graph $G(m,p)= G$. \\
%\item Let $M_{G}$ be the associated adjacency matrix.  \\
%\item If the number of non-zero entries in the matrix are less than the length of the message, then encode the entries in the matrix  $M_{G}$ using a secure method such as a one-time pad and send to the receiver.  If not, then go to step one and repeat. (At this stage the receiver has received the encoded entries in the matrix, which will then be used to construct the one dimensional simplicial complex). \\
%\item  Choose an operation $\theta$ and a big enough integer $n$.\\
%\item  Compute $\overrightarrow{f}(\theta(K(G))) = (f_0(\theta^{n}(K(G))),....,f_t(\theta^{n}(K(G))))$. If $t$ is less than the length of the message, then encode the message up to length $t$ and repeat the process for the next part of the message or repeat the process by going to step one.  If $ t  > l$, then proceed to the next step.\\
%\item Encode the message using the vector in the previous step.  That is, if the message of length $l$ is of the form $a_1,...,a_l$, then encode
%via $$a_1 + f_0(\theta^{n}(K(G))),....,a_l + f_t(\theta^{n}(K(G)))$$
%\item Send the encoded message to the receiver.\\
%\item  Receiver decodes $M_G$ and reconstructs $K(G)$ from the matrix $M_G$.\\
%\item  Receiver generates a graph using the published the chosen operation $\theta$ and $n$.\\
%\item  Receiver computes $\overrightarrow{f}$ of the resulting graph as in step 6. \\
%\item  Decode the encoded message in a fashion similar to a one-time pad.  \\
%\end{enumerate}

%\section{Results}
%
%
%%%%%%%%%JOIN STUFF%%%%
%An operation of particular interest is the join \cite{BP1} but first we have to make the following definition.
%\begin{Definition}
%Let $\mathcal{K},\mathcal{L}$ be simplicial complexes. The join of $\mathcal{K}$ and $\mathcal{L}$, denoted by $\mathcal{K}\ast\mathcal{L}$, is the simplicial complex defined as follows:
%
%$$\mathcal{K}\ast\mathcal{L}=\{x_1\cup x_2|x_1\in \mathcal{K},x_2\in\mathcal{L}\}$$.
%\end{Definition}
%
%We record the following obvious properties of the join:  it is associative and commutative.
%
%Notice that in the case that $\mathcal{L}$ is a point, then the join $\mathcal{K}\ast\mathcal{L}$ reduces to the cone over $\mathcal{K}$.
%
%We use the joint to define an operation:
%
%\begin{Example}
%For a given fixed simplicial complex $\mathcal{L}$, the \textit{k-join of $\mathcal{K}$ with $\mathcal{L}$} is the operation defined and denoted as follows:
%
%   $$\mathcal{L}_{k}(\mathcal{K})= \underbrace{\mathcal{L}\ast \cdots \ast\mathcal{L} }_{\text{$k$ times}} \ast \mathcal{K}$$
%\end{Example}
%
%The reader will notice the lack of parenthetical descriptors within the definition.  Bookkeeping of this type is unnecessary for this operation since the join is associative. We will primarily focus on this operation for very particular complexes.
%
%Recall the following calculation from \cite{BP1}. This result sheds some insight into how the components of the $f$-vector can be explicitly determined for simplicial complexes that are well-understood.
%
%\begin{Theorem}
%$f_i(\Delta^n) = \binom{n+1}{i+1}$  for $-1 \leq i \leq n$
%\end{Theorem}
%
%
%\begin{Lemma}\label{formula}
%For simplicial complexes $\mathcal{K}$ and $\mathcal{L}$
%\begin{equation}\label{e1}
%f_{q}(\mathcal{K}\ast\mathcal{L})=f_{q}(\mathcal{K})+f_{q}(\mathcal{L})+\sum_{i=0}^{q-1}f_{i}(\mathcal{K})f_{q-i}(\mathcal{L})
%\end{equation}
%\end{Lemma}
%
%\begin{proof}
%Let $\mathcal{K}_{q}$ be the set of $q$-dimensional simplicies of $\mathcal{K}$. By construction, if $z\in(\mathcal{K}\ast\mathcal{L})_{q}$ then we have one of these mutually exclusive cases:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item $z=x_1\cup \emptyset$ where $x_1\in \mathcal{K}_q$, there are $f_q(\mathcal{K})$ elements of this kind\\
%\item $z=\emptyset\cup x_2$ where $x_2\in \mathcal{L}_q$, there are $f_q(\mathcal{L})$ elements of this kind\\
%\item $z=x_1\cup x_2$ where $x_1\in \mathcal{K}_{i}$ and $x_2\in \mathcal{L}_{q-i}$ and $i\ne q$, there are $f_i(\mathcal{K})f_{q-i}(\mathcal{L})$ elements of this kind.
%\end{enumerate}
%\noindent The result follows by adding these three kinds of sets.
%\end{proof}
%
%\begin{Lemma}
%Let $\mathcal{K}_{1},\mathcal{K}_{2},\mathcal{L}$ be simplicial complexes. Then
%
%$$\overrightarrow{f}(\mathcal{K}_{1})= \overrightarrow{f}(\mathcal{K}_{2})\quad \text{iff} \quad\overrightarrow{f}(\mathcal{K}_{1}\ast\mathcal{L})= \overrightarrow{f}(\mathcal{K}_{2}\ast\mathcal{L})$$
%\end{Lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%If $\overrightarrow{f}(\mathcal{K}_{1})= \overrightarrow{f}(\mathcal{K}_{2})$ then using formula (\ref{e1}) gives the result. If $\overrightarrow{f}(\mathcal{K}_{1}\ast\mathcal{L})= \overrightarrow{f}(\mathcal{K}_{2}\ast\mathcal{L})$ then using formula (\ref{e1}) we have
%
%$$f_{0}(\mathcal{K}_{1})+f_{0}(\mathcal{L})=f_{0}(\mathcal{K}_{1}\ast\mathcal{L})= f_{0}(\mathcal{K}_{2}\ast\mathcal{L})=f_{0}(\mathcal{K}_{2})+f_{0}(\mathcal{L})$$
%
%\noindent and from this it follows that $f_{0}(\mathcal{K}_{1})=f_{0}(\mathcal{K}_{2})$. From this and using formula (\ref{e1}) again we get $f_{1}(\mathcal{K}_{1})=f_{1}( \mathcal{K}_{2})$. Using this method we obtain $f_{k}(\mathcal{K}_{1})=f_{k}( \mathcal{K}_{2})$ for all $k$.
%\end{proof}
%
%
%
%\section{NIST Test Results}
%
%For the purposes of determining whether or not the algorithm described above is suitable for potential cryptographic
%applications we have run a series of tests using the testing suite \cite{NIST}.
%
%
%\indent We include two probability-distribution graphs here, summarizing the NIST suite's analysis of two data sets generated using the cone operation.
%
%The first series of tests consisted of building on the random graph with $$f$-vector$ \{3, 3\}.  The number of operations used to grow the
%graph ranged from 3750 to 3849.  The rationale behind working in this range is that NIST suite's requirement that it be given at least 10 megabits of input data.
%Graph -----------------------------insert graph-----------------------------summarizes one hundred runs of the complexes built out of the random graph mentioned
%above.
%
%\indent In subsequent testing, the random graph-input graph-was varied with the $$f$-vectors$ ranging from $\{3, 3\}$ to
%$\{102, 201\}$.  The number of cones was fixed at 3750-to produce the required sequence of bits to feed into the
%NIST testing suite.  The results are summarized in ---------------------------graph-----insert graph here------------------------
%
%
%
%
% Using the decomposition of higher dimensional simplicies as the union of the join of lower
%dimensional simplicies analyze the $p-join$.  Let $\mathcal{K}_1,...,\mathcal{K}_p$ be simplicial complexes and let $\mathcal{K}_1 \underbrace{\ast \ast \ast}_p \mathcal{K}_p$ be the $p$-join.
%We use the notation $(\mathcal{K}_1 \underbrace{\ast \ast \ast}_p  \mathcal{K}_p)_n$ to denote the $n$-simplicies in the $p$-join. \\
%
%
%
%%problems....
%\begin{Question}
%Compute $f_j(\mathcal{K}_1 \underbrace{\ast \ast \ast}_p \mathcal{K}_p)$ and write it in closed form.
%\end{Question}
%
%%\begin{Question}
%%Using Theorem \ref{Calculation} run the algorithm through the NIST testing suite.  Here there is an additional parameter ($\Delta^n$ with this $n$ not to be confused with the ``n"
%%that is used in the cone) so there are families of polyhedra that can generate sequences of bits.
%
%
%
%
%Given a fixed random graph $R_G$ let $f_0(G) = s$ and $f_1(G) = t$.  We argue by contradiction.  Suppose for $j$ sufficiently large each $\mathcal{K}^{j+2}$ is dual to a $(j+3)$-dimensional polytope $P$ that satisfies the $g$-theorem.  Recall, $f_0(P)$ enumerates the number of facets and $f_1(P)$ enumerates the number of codimension two faces.  Since the facets are dual to the vertices in $\mathcal{K}^{j+2}$ there are $s + j$ many implying $f_0(P) = s + j$.  On the other hand, since the codimension two faces of $P$ are dual to the edges in the dual simplicial complex we obtain $f_1(P) = f_1(C^j(G))$, but this is $t + s + (s+1) +(s+2) + \cdots (s + (j-1))$ by Corollary \ref{recursion}. We re-write this sum as
%
%\begin{center}
%$t + s + \underbrace{s+ \cdots+ s}_{j-1} + [1 + \cdots+ (j-1)]$
%\end{center}
%
%This sum is:  $t +sj+j^2 - j$ and we have
%
%\begin{center}
%$f_1(P) = t +sj+j^2 - j$
%\end{center}
%
%Since we assume the $g$-theorem holds the following inequality must hold:  $f_1 \leq\binom{f_0}{2}$ and this gives the following inequality
%
%$$t +sj+j^2 - j \leq \binom{s+j}{2}$$
%
%Simplifying this inequality yields the following:
%
%$$2t + j^2-j \leq s^2-s$$
%
%We arrive at a contradiction since $s$ and $t$ are fixed.
%
%
%%\end{Question}
